# SORTSHORT
An utility written in autoit to manage and launch shortcuts 

Everytime you install an application it creates a shortcut on windows desktop, years after years yours desktop is full and youy don't know what is installed on your computer. i've thought about a program that can hepls you to sort all of thooses shortcuts in a pannel grid of 32 tiles sort themselves in list in a combobox, you can create a list for each type of shortcut and have 32 tiles in each list.

Shortcuts are created by manual selecting files or directories, or drag and drop method, you can drag a file, a folder a shortcut... etc
Shortcuts in the applicacation are manageable, you can move it (ctrl + drag and drop) on every free tile, and you can also move it on an other list, and change icon.

The Icons of every shortcut is taken (if it exists) from the program and have in complement an iconset.dll ressource
